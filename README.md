# DynamicForm PHP
An open source PHP Library for creating forms without HTML, whose structure can be defined by the user of your application instead of being hardcoded by the programmer.
## An example
Let's suppose you have an application where the users can submit form data, for example assignments or surveys. But another user (typically some kind of super user) needs to be free to define this form structure and is not supposed to know nothing about PHP, HTML, Servers, HTTP POST/get requests, SQL and so on. *That's where DynamicForm comes into action.*
## With DynamicForm you can...
1. Let the user define the structure of the form visually
1. After the structure is defined, display the form on screen
1. Validate the data before storing on database, and this includes file uploads
1. Have the form content (as well the structure) saved in your database
